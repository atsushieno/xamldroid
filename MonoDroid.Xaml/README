This is a MonoDroid port of System.Xaml.dll in mono.

The actual sources are *not* in this repository. Instead, this project file
has references to mono/mcs/class/System.Xaml/*.cs (and MonoTODO.cs).
So, to build this library, you need copy of mono sources.

(You can manually edit csproj so that it points to the sources wherever
you want them to be, but might be easier to just add System.Xaml/*/*.cs
except for *.Permissions sources, which I didn't import.)

Note that this library does *not* support serializing Android UI elements
into XAML. Those classes don't have required default constructors.
To support such serialization, you'll need custom System.Xaml enhancements.
