xamldroid is an attempt to create XAML-powered Android View wrapper.

Actually this package contains a source generator for Mono.Android.Xaml.dll.

To build Mono.Android.Xaml.dll, copy Mono.Android.dll from MonoDroid
installation to this directory and then run make.

MonoDroid.Xaml.dll comes from another project (which depends on mono/mcs):
https://github.com/atsushieno/MonoDroid.Xaml
